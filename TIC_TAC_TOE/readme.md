# Tic-Tac-Toe ❌⭕

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built from scratch using Vanilla web technologies. This project focuses on the core fundamentals of web-based game interaction.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## 🛠️ Technical Deep Dives

* **Event Handling:** Experimented with `querySelectorAll` vs. Event Delegation for capturing user input on the game board.
* **DOM Manipulation:** Learning how to link CSS classes to JavaScript logic for interactive UI.
* **Layout Design:** Using Flexbox wrapping logic to create a responsive $3 \times 3$ grid without hard-coding every position.

## 🎮 Current Features
* $3 \times 3$ interactive grid.
* Hover effects for player feedback.
* Console logging for click detection (State management in progress).

## 📝 Future Improvements
- [ ] Implement turn-switching logic (X vs O).
- [ ] Add a win-detection algorithm for rows, columns, and diagonals.
- [ ] Create a "Draw" state when the board is full.
